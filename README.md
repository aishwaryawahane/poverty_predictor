# Poverty Prediction through Satellite Imagery

## Project domain: An attempt to tackle global issues through Geospatial domain & Machine learning
- UN’s one of the topmost goals is to reduce poverty by 2030.
- This tool is an attempt to help them achieve this goal. 
- Using Machine learning & analysis of geospatial data,    we could predict poverty through satellite imagery.

## Problem
- Most countries don’t collect much data.
- Scaling up traditional survey based data collection methods are expensive.

## The Solution
Predicting poverty through data sources like satellite imagery is comparatively inexpensive. 
- Upload the satellite imagery to the site
- The model will analyse the image for nighttime luminosity features
- The model predicts the analysed wealth index of the region

## Data Sourcing
- Measure of poverty - Average wealth index of each cluster.
- “Ground truth” - DHS Survey datasets.
- Nighttime Satellite imagery - NOAA
